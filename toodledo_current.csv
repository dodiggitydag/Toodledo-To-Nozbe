"Review DynPerf as an option for performance benchmarking","Winnebago","@Home",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hi Gary-
Typically the system is evaluated and sized for the weeks of System Test.  There is a program in AX that is run against your db during the time of system test to see where we fall in the performance sector.  That information is evaluated and we tune the software based on the results to ensure optimal performance and processing time.  This is why System Test is very important and we need everyone pounding on the system as if we were LIVE.  When MS recommends hardware at time of purchase they use the number of concurrent users and sites/physical locations as a basis to size your hardware.  We typically don’t see any additional hardware purchases after the initial install.
Thank you, Santo
Santo Chisolm, CPA"
